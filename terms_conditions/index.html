        <b>Using The Scanner Service</b>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use camera icon and take as clear a photo as possible just about covering the whole scoresheet.</li>
            <li>Once you have taken a scoresheet photo the scanner displays a preview view of the scoresheet. If you are satisfied with the image, press scan icon at the bottom left.</li>
            <li>Scanner then lists all the moves it could identify/recognize. These moves are Scanner's best guesses.</li>
            <li>Adjust piece animation speed to what makes you most comfortable working with.</li>
            <li>Correct moves starting from the first move onwards by tapping on the move you would like to correct. In the horizontally scrollable popover that appears, all the legal moves from current board position are displayed. Select the correct move for the move that was incorrectly identified by the scanner.</li>
            <li>You can also correct a move using drag-and-drop by moving a piece on the board from the position that's on the board. To select a piece for drag-and-drop you have to long press the piece for a fraction of a second, which then highlights all the legal moves a piece can move to.</li>
            <li>Swipe left or right on board to move ahead or back one half-move respectively. Double tap on extreme right or extreme left of the board to move ahead or back 5 moves respectively.</li>
        </ol>
